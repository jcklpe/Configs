# Configs

This repo is a collection of configs, dotfiles, and other code snippets that I regularly use. This folder is then synced across all the different machines I use through a self hosted instance of the open-source personal cloud platform [[NextCloud]](https://nextcloud.com/) . It's a work in progress and I'm still figuring out my pipeline but I wanted to jump on the whole [[dotfiles]](https://dotfiles.github.io/) trend.

My goal is to create something that's extremely modular and contained. I work in both Windows and Linux environments, and as I come from an art/design background I want to make what I have learned as easy to access for others as possible. This is in some ways a continuation of my [[Jumpstart Hack Pack]](https://github.com/jcklpe/Jumpstart-HackPack) project (which I plan on updating with new stuff soon).

Everything is still a bit of a mess. But it's my mess!

If you have any critiques, comments, or info to share, please file an issue, or even a pull request! :)
