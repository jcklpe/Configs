# Configs

This repo is a collection of configs, dotfiles, code snippets, and scripts. This folder is then synced across all the different machines I use through a self hosted instance of the open-source personal cloud platform [[NextCloud]](https://nextcloud.com/).

I work in windows, mac, and linux environments. My goal is to create something that's extremely modular and contained.

I use zsh as my CLI shell. _(mac, windows, linux compatible)_

I use ueli as my launcher. _(mac, windows compatible)_

I use hyper as my terminal emulator. _(mac, windows, linux compatible)_

I use vscode as my code editor. _(mac, windows, linux compatible)_

As you can see almost all of these programs work on all three operating systems. This is on purpose. I am trying to make it so that no matter what OS I'm on, my basic experience remains the same.

I want to transcend operating systems! üí™ü§ìüëç

Someday I'd like to get the kinks so worked out that I can simply pull down this git repo on a machine, run a script and have everything basically fold out like George Jetson's briefcase car.

But until then this it's a work in progress, while I better figure out my pipeline.
